    " \n",
    " * **Email.** Communication with your instructor will take place over email. Use your PCC email account. Your instructor will reply to PCC email address. Your personal (non-PCC) email address may get blocked by PCC's firewall.\n",
    " \n",
    " * **D2L.** The D2L learning management system is used to post assignments, labs, and exams. Your course work, including: homework, labs, quizzes, exams and projects need to be submitted to D2L. All course grades will be stored in D2L.\n",
    " \n",
    " * Access to **the course programming environment**, available online at [https://engr114.org](https://engr114.org). An @pcc.edu email address and password is needed to login. Log into your @pcc.edu email account and then open the course programming environment. You can also use Google CoLab [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com) with your @pcc.edu account.\n",
    " \n",
    " * A **laptop, chromebook, tablet or desktop computer** is required for the course. If you are using a Windows10,  MacOS or Linux operating system, you can download the same programming environment used by your instructor.

    "If a student is unable to take the exam when it is scheduled, it is the student's responsibility to notify the instructor **at least 1 week prior to the date of an exam**. Make-up exams, if allowed, will be scheduled by the instructor after consulting with the student **prior** to the original date of the exam. I look forward to working with any students who have testing accommodations. It is the student's responsibility to set up a meeting **at least 1 week prior to the exam date** to review exam protocol.  There will be two Exams in the course. One Midterm Exam and one Exam the last week of classes (the week before finals week).\n",

    " * Exam Uploads after the deadline posted in D2L will receive a 0 (Insufficient evidence).\n",
    " * You can re-do your Exam 1. Exam 1 re-dos are due the last week of the quarter, Monday at 12noon. No Exam 1 re-do's will be accepted after this due date for a grade to give your instructor sufficient time to grade your exam re-dos by the end of the quarter.\n",
    " * Exams which contain coppied work of others will recieve a 0 (Insufficient evidence). The instructor can not assess student learning when a student submits someone else's work. A student who recieves a 0 (Insufficient evidence) on Exam 1 must complete an Exam 1 re-do by the last week of the quarter, Monday at 12noon.\n",

Your median lab score (your middle lab score, not your average lab score) will be used to calculate your final grade. Lab assignments can be re-done and re-submitted to improve your grade. All lab re-submissions must be uploaded to D2L by Monday at 12noon, the last week of the quarter (the Monday before finals week). No labs submitted after this date will be graded for course credit.
